# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
## Introduction
This repository is for my HTML and CSS projects for The Tech Academy HTML and CSS Course.
## Projects:
* Movie Theater Site
* Space Staion Site
* Battle Station's Site
* Portfolio

## [Movie Theater Site](https://codehappy01.github.io/bootstrap4_project/academy_cinemas.html)
This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Boostrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
## [Space Station Site](https://codehappy01.github.io/Space_Station/index.html)
This Page is an example of a Space travel company. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.
## [Battle Station's Site](https://codehappy01.github.io/One_Page_Website_Battle_Stations/one_page_website_battle_stations.html)
Similar to the Space Station Site, it's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, gallery and a contact form. However, this site is an example of a computer setup styling company.
## [Portfolio Site](https://codehappy01.github.io/Portfolio.html)
This is my Portfolio to showcase a little about what who I am and what skills I hold as a software developer with a contact form.
